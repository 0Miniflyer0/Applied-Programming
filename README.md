**Project Goals**:

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Research how to hide or write hidden messages in python.
2. Define the main class. And only show partial
3. Loop if wrong but display the full message if correct.

Instructions for using the software:

1.  When hitting start you will be shown the word: "hello" with the outline of world.
2. Figure out what goes after Hello (Type world)
3. Shows the whole message

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:
(Not sure if i did this seciton right)
* VSCode
* Python
* OBS (for recording, and idk what else  to put)

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* W3Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp
* Geeks for Geeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics/
* Tutorialspoint (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_syntax.htm)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Maybe make it delayed so it adds anticipation if you get the answer right or wrong.
* [ ] Try random words instead of just "Hello world"
* [ ] Maybe turn it into actual hangman and give letters if the user progrsessively gets it right.
